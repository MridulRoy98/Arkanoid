# **Description**
Immerse yourself in the captivating realm of Arkanoid, an Unreal Engine creation that reflects my journey in mastering various game development elements. In this Unreal project, I explored the intricacies of:

Unreal's input system for precise mouse control
Utilizing the spacebar to launch the ball with precision
Implementing a dynamic brick-counting system
Level restarting mechanics triggered by the ball going offscreen
# **Gameplay**
Embark on a thrilling adventure where your mouse becomes your paddle, and the spacebar launches the ball into a world of bricks and challenges. Experience the classic Arkanoid gameplay with a modern twist as you navigate through levels, break bricks, and strive for a high score.

# **Controls**
Master the game with these controls:

Control the paddle using your mouse.
Launch the ball with precision using the spacebar.
Experience the simplicity of Arkanoid's controls, allowing for an intuitive and enjoyable gaming experience.

# **Installation**
